The Blocking assignment is stopage assignment. it means after defining the value will change.
it is the normal assignment that occure at programming and systemc. 
for instance
a=b;
c=a;
d=c; 

The above example execute step by step and change the value at each step. it is basicly 
d=b;

On the other hand the non-blocking assignment follow the change after all sequential 
instruction are executed. it exactly has two values, current value and old value. similar to 
delta cycle in systemc.

a <= b;
c <= a;
d <= c;

In above example the d will not be equal to b, but the old value of the c.

Generally speaking, in VLSI design always, but in few exceptions, the assignment occure at
the end of clock period. 

Given this explanation, we could use for latch and ffs we could the blocking assignment,
but the order of instructions become the matter of importance to avoid synthesis and simulatiom mismatch..

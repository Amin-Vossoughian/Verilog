The Blocking assignment is stopage assignment. it means after defining the value will change.
it is the normal assignment that occure at programming ans systemc. 
for instance
a=b;
c=a;
d=c; 

The above example execute step by step and chanve the value at each step. it is basicly 
d=b;

On the other hand the non-blocking assignment follow the change after all sequential 
instruction are executed. it exactly has two value, current value and old value. similar to 
delta cycle in systemc.

a <= b;
c <= a;
d <= c;

In above example the d will not be equal to b, but the old value of the c.

Generally speaking, in VLSI design always but in few exception, the assignment occure at
the end of clock period. 

Given this explanation, we could use for latch the blocking assignment, but for ffs, we have
to use non-blocking assignment. although in sysnthesis the result was the same, always do that.
